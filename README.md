# To-Do-List
This is a simple to-do list which I created during Python Developer course at JetBrains Academy. The To-Do-List allows to add new tasks and delete done tasks. It also displays tasks for today and tasks for the upcoming week. If the deadline for some tasks would be missed, that tasks would be displayed in "Missed tasks".

The To-Do-List will help you to manage time effectively and do more in less time.

## Prerequisites

Make sure you have installed SQLAlchemy within your environment before running the To-Do-List.

## Launching 

To run the To-Do-List, type: 
```
  python To-Do-List.py
```
## Built With

That project was created during studies at [Python Developer course by JetBrains Academy](https://hyperskill.org/onboarding/tracks/2/projects/105).
